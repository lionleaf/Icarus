Icarus is an android game utilizing the accelerometer of your Android device to let you see how long you can suspend the phone in free fall. Just press "fly" and it will time any weightlessness it experiences. See your own high scores and how well you're doing in the global competition. Submit your best scores to the database, and look them up at the web page.
